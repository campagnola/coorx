API Issues to work out:

  - MatrixTransform and STTransform both have 'scale' and 'translate'
    attributes, but they are used in very different ways. It would be nice
    to keep this consistent, but how?

  - Need a transform.map_rect function that returns the bounding rectangle of
    a rect after transformation. Non-linear transforms might need to work
    harder at this, but we can provide a default implementation that
    works by mapping a selection of points across a grid within the original
    rect.
